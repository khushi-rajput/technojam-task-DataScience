technojam-task-DataScience

As a Data Science Enthusiast and Computer Science student, I am driven by a passion for data and technology. 
Throughout my academics, I have developed a strong foundation in Python, SQL programming languages, data analysis, and databases. I aim to innovate and contribute to the tech industry.

Fascinated by AI and Machine Learning , I actively explore various domains. Exploring data sets, discovering some graphs or patterns and online courses, I continuously enhance my skills.
As a fresher, I'm eager to gain real-world experience and opportunities to make a positive impact.

I completed the easy task question in python language because it has simple syntax and differnt libraries that are very useful in data analysis or data science and easy to understand. The only problem which I faced was in upload the dataset in colab.
